# analyzing-data-with-python
How to load data, to building basic mIt will start you off with the basics, the libraries you need and how to work with data. You will learn how to analyze data using summary statistics; this section is useful if you would like to make an argument with data. Finally, you will learn how to build Machine Learning Models and see how these models work in the real world.
